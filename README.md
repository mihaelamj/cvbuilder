# CVBuilder

CVBuilder is a modular Swift package designed to represent and render CV (curriculum vitae) data in a structured, reusable way. It provides clean data models, rendering logic for Markdown and plain text, and optional support for HTML rendering using [Ignite](https://github.com/twostraws/Ignite).

---

## ✨ Features

- 📄 Strongly typed data model for CVs: education, experience, skills, contact info, etc.
- 🧩 Modular architecture: core types are renderer-agnostic.
- 🖋️ Renderers for:
  - **Markdown** (via `MarkdownCVRenderer`)
  - **Plain text** (via `StringCVRenderer`)
  - **HTML** with [Ignite](https://github.com/twostraws/Ignite) (via `IgniteRenderer` in `CVBuilderIgnite`)
- 🧪 Unit-testable and reusable across platforms.

---

## 🧱 Package Structure

This package includes two main libraries:

### 1. `CVBuilder` (core)

Contains all model types and basic rendering:

```
CV
├── ContactInfo
├── Education
├── WorkExperience
│   ├── Company
│   ├── Role
│   └── ProjectExperience
│       ├── Project
│       └── Tech
└── Period
```

Renderers in `CVBuilder`:
- `MarkdownCVRenderer`
- `StringCVRenderer`

### 2. `CVBuilderIgnite` (optional)

Provides `IgniteRenderer` for HTML rendering, using the [Ignite](https://github.com/twostraws/Ignite) static site generator.

> 🔥 Note: This target depends on `Ignite` and is **separated** to avoid pulling in C dependencies in projects that don’t need HTML rendering.

---

## 📦 Usage

### Add to your `Package.swift` (using branch until Ignite is tagged):

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/mihaelamj/cvbuilder.git", branch: "main")
```

Then add the desired product:

```swift
.product(name: "CVBuilder", package: "cvbuilder"),
.product(name: "CVBuilderIgnite", package: "cvbuilder") // if using Ignite
```

## 🛠 How to Generate a Markdown CV

Currently, the best way to generate a Markdown CV is through Swift code:

```swift
import CVBuilder

let cv = CV.createExampleCV()
let markdown = MarkdownCVRenderer(cv: cv).render()
print(markdown)
```

Or use the utility method to save it:

```swift
if let markdownFile = CV.convertTMarkdownAndSave(cv) {
    print("Markdown saved to: \(markdownFile)")
}
```

> ℹ️ A command-line interface to generate and export Markdown or HTML versions of your CV is currently **in progress**.
